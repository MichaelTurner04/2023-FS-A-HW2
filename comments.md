## Detailed Comments:

-   The experience per book calculation was supposed to be done with `int`s, to demonstrate the truncation of decimal digits.
-   Variables should be declared in the scope closest to where they will be used; sometimes, this is at the top of the enclosing function, but in this case you should have declared your variables at the start of each chapter.
-   I think the constants were intended to be placed above the `main` function, but it's not that important.

Score: 105

Excellent work :)
